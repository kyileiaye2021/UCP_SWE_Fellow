"""Question 1: Graph Algorithms Using Adjacency List/Set Representation (1 hr, 40 min max)
Given an array of pairs of values representing edges in an unweighted graph, create the equivalent adjacency list/set representation (a map from element to a list or set of elements). 
Pairs represent directed edges: (A, B) means there is an edge from A to B. If the pair (B, A) is also provided, then there is an undirected edge between A and B. 
For simplicity, you may assume that each node of the graph stores an integer rather than a generic data type and that the elements are distinct. 
Implement a basic DFS and BFS that search for a target value and two topological sorts (using each of DFS and Kahnâ€™s algorithm).

// Build graph representation. You can also use an array rather than a set
map<int, set<int>> adjacencySet(array<pair<int, int>> edges);

// Example
Input: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 0)]
Output:
{
    0: []
    1: [2, 3]
    2: [0, 3]
    3: [2]
}

bool bfs(int target, map<int, set<int>> graph);
bool dfs(int target, map<int, set<int>> graph);
array<int> topologicalSort(map<int, set<int>> graph);
array<int> topologicalSortDfs(map<int, set<int>> graph);
